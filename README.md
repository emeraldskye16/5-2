•	Summarize the project and the problem it was solving. 
This project's programming task was to create an item tracker for a grocery store. The program needed to analyze the text records generated throughout the day. The records must list items bought chronologically from when the store opens to when it closes. The program also needed to be able to rearrange the produce section and know how often items are bought so a user-focused layout could be created and displayed.

•	What did you do particularly well? 
I managed my time well when completing this project, which allowed me to produce clean code at industry standards.

•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 
The code could be enhanced with more comments. I could use more detailed comments, making my code easier to read.

•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 
Adding the additional functionality for manipulating the data was challenging. I looked back at the lessons in zybooks to help find a solution to my issue.

•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 
The overall knowledge gained from this project will be helpful in the future. Parts of this program can be used for future projects. This program can easily manipulate other types of data sets with minor edits.

•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
This program can easily be adapted to manipulate other data sets with minor edits. It was written with industry standards in mind so that it would be readable to others. The program’s adaptability is also a result of its ability to be maintained. Since clean code was written, future major updates should be avoided, and minor updates can be applied to meet users' requests or feedback.
